# 3D Game Engine - MangoKart

## Team members
Asanshay Gupta and Ethan Boneh

## Project description
A 3D graphics rendering module that renders a world in 3D given a camera position and the objects in the world and an implementation of that module in a game similar to MarioKart.

## Hardware, budget
- Accelerometer for controller
- 3D Printed controller

## Tasks, member responsibilities
**Asanshay**: Drawing functions, rendering functions, object creation utilities, module design
**Ethan**: Projection math, game design, hardware integration, accelerometer based control system

## Schedule, midpoint milestones

1. Drawing functions 
2. Projections
3. Render function
4. Draw axes, draw objects
5. **3/10 Checkpoint 1**: rendering a basic object in a still frame (entirely in frame)
6. Culling for performance
7. **3/12 Checkpoint 2**: rendering any object in a still frame
    1. Objects not all in frame
    2. Objects behind each other
8. Game module init
9. Camera position movement based on keyboard
10. Evaluate hardware/game options
11. **3/13: Major Checkpoint 1:** replicate pygame graphics engine
12. Implement hardware control
13. Design game itself


## Resources needed, issues
What are the possible risks to overcome? What are you concerned about? 
- It'll be hard to make the engine perform well, so that'll be the main challenge, as well as making an immersive game environment
How can we help you succeed?
- Lots of help with performance optimizations would be ideal
